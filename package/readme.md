## üî• How to use

To use the library, you need to first import the API methods into your project.

```js
import {
  useHashnodePosts,
  useHashnodePostDetails,
  useHashnodePage,
  useHashnodeComments,
} from "hashnode-client";
```

Then use them with their input parameters in the React component:

```js
const settings = { host: "blog.greenroots.info" };

const { loading, posts, loadMorePost, pageInfo } = useHashnodePosts(settings);
```

> Note: If you are using NextJS, please use this library in the client component only, as it uses useEffect and useState behind the scenes.

## ü§æ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è hashnode-client playground(demo)

We have built a demo project called `hashnode-diaries` that uses the hooks that we have mentioned above. It's a simple project that will take the URL of your publication and fetch data from hashcode, and demo ur project.

You can [run it locally](../hashcode-diaries/README.md) and get a feel of how to use the package in a way that is beneficial to your project.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to build the hashnode-client package?

You can build the project using the following command for the production environment:

```bash
## With NPM
npm run build

## With YARN
yarn build

## With PNPM
pnpm run build

```

In the development environment, none of the source files get minified. You can build the project using the following command for the development environment:

```bash
## With NPM
npm run build:dev

## With YARN
yarn build:dev

## With PNPM
pnpm run build:dev

```

## üé¢ How to test the hashnode-client package locally?

Once you have built the project using the above command, you need to create a package locally to start testing.

To create the package locally,

- Create a directory called `tar` at the root of the `package` folder.
- Execute the following command to create the tar package.

  ```bash
  ## With NPM
  npm run create-tar

  ## With YARN
  yarn create-tar

  ## With PNPM
  pnpm run create-tar
  ```

- The above command will create a tar package inside the `tar` folder.
- You can now install the tar package into your project using the following command:

  ```bash
  ## With NPM
  npm install file:<PATH-TO-THE-TAR-FILE>

  ## With YARN
  yarn add file:<PATH-TO-THE-TAR-FILE>

  ## With PNPM
  pnpm run file:<PATH-TO-THE-TAR-FILE>
  ```
